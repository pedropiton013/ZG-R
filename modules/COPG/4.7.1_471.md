## v4.7.1
### HOTFIX Update
- Added blocked tag to all device packages for safety
- Fixed Update Gameslist and action button
### Note: 
- I recommend you add your game always as blocked package expect games those aren't working with device spoof only or they only work with CPU spoof

## v4.7.0
### New Features
*   **Safer Spoof Method:** Enhanced safety and reliability of the spoofing process.
*   **Android/SDK Spoof:** Added optional Android SDK version spoofing capability.
*   **Smart CPU Spoof (Snapdragon 8 Elite):** Introduces intelligent, app-targeted CPU information spoofing via `/proc/cpuinfo`.
*   **Enhanced Configuration (`COPG.json`):**
    *   Configuration file renamed from `config.json` to `COPG.json` (original `config.json` remains for MMRL app settings).
    *   **`blocked` tag:** For apps/games where you want device model spoofing but need to hide/remove CPU spoof.
    *   **`with_cpu` tag:** For apps/games where you want both device model spoofing and CPU spoofing applied together.
    *   **`cpu_only_packages`:** For apps/games where you want **only** CPU spoofing applied (also resets device properties to original via `resetprop`).
    *   **`blocklist`:** To hide/remove CPU spoof and reset properties for sensitive apps (e.g., banking apps, camera apps in Matrix ROM, system settings in some ROMs).
    *   **`notweak` tag:** Significantly improves I/O performance and reduces overhead for specified packages.
*   **Smarter Tweak Controller:** Improved configuration handling logic.
*   **Enhanced WebUI:**
    *   Added sorting and filtering capabilities.
    *   Source code cleanup and full support for all new configuration changes.
*   **Updated Game Support:**
    *   Added support for **Fortnite** and **Farlight 84**.
    *   Removed support for **Mobile Legends: Bang Bang**.

### Improvements
*   **Permission & SELinux:** Better handling during `COPG.json` restoration.
*   **Logging:**
    *   Simplified Zygisk logs.
    *   Changed log tag from `SpoofModule` to `COPGModule`.
*   **Configuration Management:** Removed deprecated `ignorelist.txt` and associated functions from the controller and WebUI.

### Summary
